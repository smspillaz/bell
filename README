Bell plugin for Compiz 0.9x

A simple plugin which lets Compiz make an audible bell sound whenever
X causes the system bell event. Depends on libcanberra.

How to build

This assumes using a modern, supported version of Ubuntu (such as 11.04). First,
install the dependencies.

  # apt-get install compiz-dev libcanberra-dev ccsm
  # apt-get build-dep compiz

Clone git repo and then cd into it. Then:

  $ mkdir build
  $ cd build
  $ cmake ..
  $ make && make install

Then restart compiz (log out or back in, or run "unity --replace") and use ccsm to
load the plugin from the Utility section of the plugin list.
